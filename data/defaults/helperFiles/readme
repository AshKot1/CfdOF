Please note: {} placeholders should be set at locations where information has to be set at runtime.

Because openfoam makes use of a lot of "{" and "}" as place holders in dictionaries, these curly brackets should be doubled.
i.e. 
FoamFile
{{
    version     2.0;
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    location    "{0}";
    object      ;
}}

The {0} will be inserted at runtime via ==> text.format("Hello") where the curly brackets which have to appear
within the actual file has been doubled .ie {{ and }}
